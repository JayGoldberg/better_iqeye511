<P>You have exited a settings page before a requested change has been
verified by the camera.  Your browser window may become confused.
This can normally be corrected by hitting Reload/Refresh in your
browser.

<P><font size = "-1">When making changes in camera
settings, wait for each setting change to be executed and acknowledged
before proceeding.  On a fast connection this normally takes a few
seconds.  On slow connections time delays can vary, watch the display
on your settings page to view the results of your command before
proceeding.</font>
