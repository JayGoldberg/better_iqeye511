acamode AC lighting
acamode_help (60hz default) This setting optimizes the camera for the region&rsquo;s electrical profile. Some countries (like the U.S.A.) use AC power with a 60 Hertz (Hz) frequency. 50Hz is used in many other countries, including all of Europe. A few countries use both frequencies. Setting 60Hz also sets NTSC analog output mode. Setting 50Hz sets PAL analog output.
AccHrs Access Hours
AccHrs_help Access to camera images can be limited on weekends or weekdays (or both). Set weekdays or weekends to ON or OFF to allow or deny access to camera images for the selected days. Alternatively, select TIMER, then specify the periods when images will be accessible by entering the start and stop times in 24 hour format (hh:mm, e.g. 16:00 = 4 PM, 01:00 = 1 AM). During &quot;OFF&quot; hours, camera images will be accessible only to the management user. Others will see the access denied message on a black background.

bandlim bandwidth limit (kbits/sec)
bandlim_help This sets the maximum network bandwidth limit in kilobits per second. &quot;Unlimited&quot; means that image streams are delivered at full speed. Bandwidth limit can be changed so an image stream doesn&rsquo;t take up all the bandwidth on the network. Specifying a non-zero value will restrict the camera to that amount of bandwidth. For example, a value of 64 will limit the frame rate of the camera so that it outputs no more than 64 kilobits of image data each second. The value &quot;0&quot; will be accepted as an alternate method of specifying &quot;unlimited.&quot;

cropset_help The crop tab allows you to customize your field of view within the overall scene your camera is currently viewing.  Use cropping to eliminate portions of the field-of-view you do not want to see. For example, if you are looking at a parking lot, you may wish to crop out the sky.  Cropping may improve frame rate significantly provided you have the camera set to &quot;unlimited&quot; frame rate on the <a href=basicset.html target=_blank>setup tab</a><p>Note that any portion of the overall scene that you crop out is not being processed or transmitted by the camera, and is not recoverable on recorded video after an event.</p><p>You have two methods for cropping an image:</p><ul><li><b>Using the presets in the drop down</b>  You will have multiple selections that vary depending on what the maximum resolution of your IQeye camera is. These preset crop resolutions follow industry-standard crop sizes (VGA, SVGA, 720p, 1080p, etc.). If you use a preset crop, you can subsequently drag that crop box around in the field of view to get the portion of the overall field of view you wish to display. This can be achieved by left click+HOLD anywhere inside the crop box with your mouse, dragging the box, then releasing the left click when the box is in the desired location.<li><b>Manually cropping</b>  Using the boundary box overlaid on the preview window, left click+HOLD on any of the eight anchor locations, this will allow you to stretch the box in either one or two dimensions depending on which anchor you choose.</ul><p>Once you have chosen a preset or manually dragged and sized the box to your liking, press the <b>apply</b> button to set your camera to use the crop settings currently shown on the preview display.</p><p>Press the <b>default</b> button to restore the cropping to factory default.</p><p>If you make a change you wish to undo and have not hit the <b>apply</b> button yet, hit <b>cancel</b> to restore the box to where it was before you made adjustments.</p> <p><b><u>Note</u></b> that if you are archiving images with IQrecorder, setting a new crop will change the crop of future archived images.</p>

iqrecset IQrecorder settings
iqrec_help IQrecorder enables you to setup your camera to record images on an internal card or an external FTP server, and to view the recorded images as an image stream. Images stored can be &quot;normal&quot; (regularly stored at a fixed record rate), or &quot;event&quot; (stored when triggered by motion and/or an external input).  You can view the recorded images by following the <a href=playback.html target=_blank>&quot;PLAYBACK&quot;</a> link at the top of any of the administration web pages. Playback requires the Sun Java Plug-in version 1.4.1 or later. During playback, you can step forward and backward through all images, or through event images only.
iqrec_motion_help Specify if detected motion will cause an event to be recorded. Go to the <a href=motionset.html target=_blank>Motion Settings Page</a> to set up motion detection windows within the camera image and to set parameters for those windows.<p>This sets the same parameter as the motion setting on the <a href=triggerset.html target=_blank>Trigger Settings Page</a>.
iqrec_extinp_help Specify if the input from an attached device will cause event images to be recorded either when the device relay opens or when it closes.<p>This sets the same parameter as the external input setting on the <a href=triggerset.html target=_blank>Trigger Settings Page</a>
iqrecres_help Choose the size/resolution (width by height) in pixels of the recorded event images. The maximum size given in this setting may be affected by the crop window setting on the <a href=cropset.html target=_blank>Window Settings Page
iqrec_minimg_help Specify the minimum number of images to record per motion or external input trigger. There could be more images recorded per event if several triggers (motion or external relay) occur in quick succession. In that case, your camera will store many images as one long event. 
iqrec_numpre_help Specify how many of the minimum stored images are pre-event images, taken by your camera before the event trigger occurs. The remainder of the event images will be post-event images, taken after the event trigger occurs.
iqrec_fr_help Specify the rate at which your camera will record event images when it receives an event trigger (a motion or external input trigger).  Choose &rsquo;max&rsquo; for the maximum rate at which the camera can record images.
iqrec_recres_help Choose the size/resolution (width by height) in pixels of the recorded event images. The maximum size given in this setting may be affected by the maximum size setting on the <a href=imageset.html target=_blank>Image Settings Page</a> and the crop window setting on the <a href=&quot;cropset.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>Window Settings Page</a>
iqrec_recto_help Specify if you wish to record to your camera&rsquo;s internal card (if installed) or to an external FTP server.<p>On-camera storage of IQrecorder images applies only to cameras with card support.
iqrec_recIP_help Specify the IP address (like 128.73.220.67) of the remote FTP server to which your camera will transfer the recorded images.  You may use a DNS name (like ftp.mycompany.com) if you have configured a nameserver on the <a href=serverset.html target=_blank>Network Settings Page</a><p>This sets the same parameter as the ftp hostname setting on the <a href=triggerset.html target=_blank>Trigger Settings Page</a>
iqrec_username_help Define the username that the camera will use when logging into the FTP server. You may enter &quot;anonymous&quot; if your FTP server will allow anonymous write-access. The username can be obtained from the person responsible for managing the FTP server.<p>This sets the same parameter as the username setting on the <a href=triggerset.html target=_blank>Trigger Settings Page</a>
iqrec_password_help Specify the password that the camera will use when logging into the FTP server. Valid password characters are the alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9). The password can be obtained from the person responsible for managing the FTP server.<p>This sets the same parameter as the password setting on the <a href=triggerset.html target=_blank>Trigger Settings Page</a>
iqrec_maxstor_help The maximum storage used by this camera on the FTP server or internal card measured in gigabytes.  Enter the value &quot;unlimited&quot; if you do not want the camera to manage its disk space for you.<p>When storage used passes 80% of the max storage value, a warning e-mail will be sent to the e-mail recipients specified on this page. When storage reaches the max storage value, either image storage will be suspended, or old images will be deleted (as specified in the &quot;near max storage&quot; pulldown).
iqrec_nrmax_help Specify whether the camera will overwrite old files when it exceeds its storage limit or whether it will suspend recording and e-mail warnings as it nears that limit.
iqrec_nat_help NAT (network address translation) is a method for connecting multiple computers and devices to the internet using one IP address, that of the router to your subnet.   Each communication on the internet specifies sending and receiving ip addresses and ports.  The devices on your subnet may be using &quot;reserved&quot; ip addresses which are not in use on the external internet.  Communications between these devices and the external internet must be &quot;re-addressed&quot; as coming from/to ports on your router. Your router keeps a table of these forwarding addresses so that communications from the internet go to the correct devices.
iqrec_pubIP_help If you are using a different IP address, for example the IP address of your router, to view IQrecorder images from a remote location, enter that IP address here.
iqrec_port_help If you are using a different IP address, for example the IP address of your router, and port fowarding to view IQrecorder images from a remote location, enter the port number here. You may leave this blank to use the default FTP port of 21.
iqrec_ErrNot_help Use this section to specify whether you want IQrecorder warning and error conditions to trigger the sending of e-mails.
iqrec_notif_help Specify whether e-mail will be sent when IQrecorder tries to record an image and fails.  This could occur, for example, if your camera or your FTP server becomes disconnected from the network.  It might also occur if your FTP server runs out of space and is not set up to overwrite older images.
iqrec_SmmsIP_help Specify the IP address of the SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) server on the camera&rsquo;s network.  The mail server must be an SMTP server.  You may use a name instead of an IP address if you have configured a nameserver on the <a href=serverset.html target=_blank>Network Settings Page</a><p>This sets the same parameter as the mailserver setting on the <a href=serverset.html target=_blank>Network Settings Page</a>
iqrec_rcpts_help If &quot;near max storage&quot; has value &quot;suspend/notify&quot;, and the camera is nearing its storage limit on the recorder, warning e-mails will be sent to the user or users specified here.  Separate multiple addresses by spaces.  For example,<br>&quot;user1@yourcompany.com user2@yourcompany.com&quot;<p>This sets the same parameter as the recipient(s) setting on the <a href=triggerset.html target=_blank>Trigger Settings Page</a>
iqrec_sched_help A simple schedule that allows users to specify a start and stop time in 24-hour format (hh:mm) when the camera will record on a specific day.  Advanced recording schedules can be configured by using a cronscript.

motion motion
motmode_help For each window, choose whether its interior is to be included or excluded (or if that motion window is to be disabled) from consideration by the motion detection algorithm. The algorithm will use every pixel that is in an included window but not in any exclude windows. Exclude windows are drawn in red. Include windows are drawn in blue.</p><p>For each included box, you must set two threshold values, <b>sensitivity</b> and <b>size</b>.
motsens motion sensitivity
motsens_iq4_help The 4 Series includes a powerful and intelligent on-board motion detection.  To test a particular motion detection setting, look at the preview window on the setup tab. When motion is detected, the border around the image will turn green temporarily.<br>The 4 Series Motion Settings are designed to provide motion alarms in typical environments. Your options are for low, medium, or high sensitivity. At high sensitivity, nearly any perceived motion in the field-of-view will trigger the camera. At medium setting, typical motion in the field-of-view will usually trigger the camera.  At low sensitivity, only significant motion across a large portion of the field of view will trigger the camera.
motsens_help sensitivity: (default = auto) specifies how much a pixel value must change in order for that change be a motion trigger. Sensitivity values range between 0 and 255. The default value, of &quot;auto&quot;, will be sufficient for most applications. Auto is high enough to filter out most noise and slight lighting changes, and low enough to detect most motion. If auto doesn&rsquo;t give the right sensitivity, change the value. Lower values increase sensitivity and higher values decrease it. A sensitivity of 255 triggers only with a change between absolute black and absolute white. Sensitivity values under 10 are not recommended as they often trigger from imager noise even when no motion is visible to the eye. 
motset motion settings
motset_help Use the motion tab to configure motion detection on the camera.
motsize_help (default = 1) range is 0 to 100. Specifies what percentage of the pixels in a box must change (by the sensitivity) in order that &quot;enough&quot; change has occurred to trigger motion detection.
mottitle Define motion zones
mottitle1 Define motion zone
mottitle_help Use the motion tab to configure motion detection on the camera.<br>The motion detection algorithm running on the camera will trigger when &quot;significant&quot; change has occurred to &quot;enough&quot; pixels in a chosen part of the camera&rsquo;s image. The default action is to use all pixels in the image for motion detection. When motion is detected, the border around the image will turn green temporarily.<br>For the motion zone window, threshold values for sensitivity and size must be set. 

motwindow_help To choose the boundaries of a window, use the &quot;window&quot; drop-down menu to choose which window you are setting. The selected window has its corners marked with solid squares. If no window is marked, left click+HOLD at the point on the image where the top-left of the window will appear. Then drag to where the bottom-right of the rectangle should be positioned.  Then release the left click button.  If a window is marked, left click+HOLD on a corner or side of a window to move that corner or side. Drag it to the new desired location, and then release the left click button. Left click+HOLD in the center of a window will allow the position of the window to be moved without altering its size.  A new window can be started by clicking outside the existing window. The click will specify where the top-left of the window appears. Drag to the bottom-right and release the mouse button.

An external nameserver must be specified for the camera to access an FTP server by using its text-based name. Since network devices can only recognize numeric IP addresses, a nameserver is needed to resolve the correct numeric IP address from a text-based name used in a connection request. 

netmask subnet mask
netmask_help Specify the subnet mask, or netmask, that the camera should use. IP networks can be divided into several smaller networks by subnetting. When a network is subnetted, you must specify a subnet mask which tells network devices which smaller network they belong to.

privwin privacy windows
privwin_help Use the privacy tab to cover parts of your camera&rsquo;s image with privacy masks. <b>Note</b> that privacy masks will blacken all pixels in their window.  This is done at the imager, so any video from the camera cannot be reconstructed to ignore the privacy masks. Note that privacy mask can also change the affects of exclude and include windows from the <a href=exposure.html target=_blank>exposure tab</a><p>You can configure up to 8 rectangular privacy windows in the image to be masked from view. By default there are zero privacy masks.  If any privacy masks have been configured, the drop-down menu includes all currently-configured privacy windows plus, at the end of the drop-down, an entry for one un-configured privacy window. After that window is configured, another un-configured privacy window selection will be added to the drop-down menu.</p><p>Should you select <b>NEW</b> and wish to create an additional privacy mask, move your cursor over to the preview window and left click+HOLD then drag the shape and size of your window. To adjust a privacy mask after creation, use the boundary box overlaid on the exposure preview window and left click+HOLD on any of the eight anchor locations. This will allow you to stretch the box in either one or two dimensions depending on which anchor you choose.</p><p>To delete the current privacy mask, select a privacy mask from the drop down and hit the <b>delete button</b>.  The currently selected privacy window will be deleted and all subsequent privacy windows will be renumbered downward by one. For example, if window 2 is deleted, window 3 will become window 2, window 4 will become window 3, etc. The number of selections in the &quot;selected&quot; drop-down will also decrease. You can click on the <b>restore defaults</b> link on the bottom left of the page to delete all privacy masks.</p>

quality JPEG quality
quality_help The camera defaults to &quot;high&quot; quality, which is a good balance of image quality and file size. Quality can be decreased to &quot;medium&quot; which produces smaller files with lower image quality, or increased to &quot;fine&quot; or &quot;superfine&quot; which creates higher quality images with larger files. If there is a limited amount of network bandwidth, a smaller file size (lower quality) will transmit faster while a larger file size (higher quality) will transmit slower. If there is sufficient bandwidth available, changing quality will not affect frame rate. If bandwidth is limited, increasing the quality may reduce frame rate.
